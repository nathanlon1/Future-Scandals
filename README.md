<hr>
For our project we are creating an app which allows users to create, share, and follow various blogs. On the homepage, users can see the latest blogs uploaded by users. Users will be able to like these blogs by opening them and clicking the like button. They can further comment on the blogs at the bottom of the page. When creating a blog, users will ideally be able to use the markdown language to insert html tags to customize their post<sup>[1]</sup>. <br>

<br>
The different views for our app will include a homepage, account login page, profile page, and blog detail page. These views will allow the user to easily access blog posts and follow users with blog content that they like. <br>
<br>
These will all be organized in the following apps: accounts, blogs, views. Accounts will contain the views for each userâ€™s profile and such. Blogs will contain the detail view of each blog as well as the edit and create page. Views will contain the homepage, containing the following and popular stream.
