The blog app first and foremost contains the model for blog posts and comments on these blog posts.

These models are then used in the views to display the page for each individual blog post. The post is displayed using markdown tags and then comments are added below it. Users can add comments and edit or delete the blog (if they're the author) from this view.

The blog app further contains all views related to creating, editing, and deleting comments and blog posts. The view for creating and editing blog posts uses a preview of the markdown tags, and the delete view serves as a confimration.
