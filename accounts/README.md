The accounts app is responsible for the custom user model used. This model contains the display name, which allows users to change their username without changing their login information.

This app then contains the views for logging in and signing up. These forms are displayed using crispy forms.

Finally, the profile view of each account is stored in this app. This allows users to click on a username and see all posts by a user.
